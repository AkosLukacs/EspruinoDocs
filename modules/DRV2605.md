This module is for controlling a DRV2605 motor driver. Use the [DRV2605](/modules/DRV2605.js) ([About Modules](/Modules)) module for it. It has its origins as a port of Ladyada's [Arduino library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_DRV2605_Library/).

More more on the chip, see the [datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv2605.pdf) and the guide by [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-drv2605-haptic-controller-breakout/overview). This Espruino module has been only tested with Adafruit's DRV2605 breakout.


You can wire this up as follows:

| Device Pin | Espruino |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 1 (VIN)    | 3.3      |
| 2 (GND)    | GND      |
| 3 (SCL)    | SCL      |
| 4 (SDA)    | SDA      |

As an example, for an [Espruino Pico](http://www.espruino.com/Pico), use B6 for SCL and B7 for SDA. This corresponds to [I2C1](http://www.espruino.com/I2C).


# Initialisation

Assuming the breakout is wired up to the B6 and B7 (I2C on the Pico):

```
I2C1.setup({scl: B6, sda: B7 });
var hap = require('DRV2605').connect(I2C1);
```

# Basic usage

Triggering a single effect can be done by numeric index (see section 11.2 in the [datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/DRV2605.pdf)), or by effect name.

```
// By index:
hap.trigger(6);

// Or by name:
hap.trigger('sharp click 30%');
```

# Sequencer

Effects can be assembled into a sequence of up to eight steps (positions 0-7). The sequencer stops if any step is empty. `setWaveform(step, effect)` sets a particular sequence step:

```
// Set sequencer step 0 to be effect 6
hap.setWaveform(0, 6);

// Or by name:
hap.setWaveform(0, 'sharp click 30%');
```

Once steps are filled in, the sequence can be started or stopped

```
// Start sequence
hap.start();

// Stop
hap.stop();
```

`setSequence(steps)` allows you to set all the steps at once:

```
// Make a sequence of three effects (by index)
hap.setSequence([70, 106, 47]);
hap.start();
```

Names can be used to make code more readable:

```
hap.setSequence([
  'ramp down long smooth 1',
  'ramp up long smooth 1 half',
  'buzz 1 100%'
  ]);
hap.start();
```

# Effect names

Effect names are based on names from the datasheet. To list them:

```
for (let i=0;i<hap.EFFECTS.length;i++) {
  console.log( (i+1) + '. '+ hap.EFFECTS[i]);
}
```

Fetch the index of an effect by name. -1 is returned if the name was not found.

```
hap.getWaveform('soft fuzz 60%'); // Returns 13
```

# Real-time mode

Real-time mode allows for direct control of motor. To use, first call `setMode('rtp')`. Note that motor will continue running, use `setMode('internal-trigger')` to stop it and return to the default behaviour.

In the example below, two arrays are used, defining amplitude (ie. power, on a 0-127 range) and delay periods (ie. how long to run for each step). It's a good idea not to run the motor continuously for very long, it's designed for very short intervals.

```
hap.setMode('rtp');

// Motor power, per step
let powers =  [30, 100, 30, 200, 90, 100];

// Duration (ms), per step
let durations = [100, 200, 100, 300, 200, 100];

// Current step
let index = 0;

const fire = function() {
  if (powers.length !== durations.length) throw new Error('powers and delays arrays must be same length');
  let i = index;
  if (i < powers.length) {
    hap.setRealtimeValue(powers[i]);
    index++;
    setTimeout(fire, durations[i]);
  } else {
    hap.setMode('internal-trigger');
    console.log('Done.');
  }
};
fire();
```

# Configuration

By default, the it's assumed an ERM (Eccentric Rotating Mass) motor is wired up. If you're using a LRA (Linear Resonance Actuator) motor, call `useLRA()` after initialisation.

There are a few modes of operation. See the datasheet for more info on this. `internal-trigger` is the initial mode.
  
```
// 'internal-trigger', 'external-trigger-rising', 'external-trigger-falling',
// 'pwm', 'audio',
// 'rtp', 'diagnostics', 'calibration'

// Real-time mode
hap.setMode('rtp)'
```
