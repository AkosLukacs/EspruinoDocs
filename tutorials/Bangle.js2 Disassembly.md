While not mentioned explicitly in the video, we'd recommend a 3D printer heated bed to warm up your Bangle.js display. These will generally hit 80°C without trouble, and you're more likely to have (or have a friend that has) access to one than a hot plate.

**Note:** The LCD display **will** suffer lasting damage if heated to 100°C or more, so it's very important to be careful with the temperature and take your time. Not all watch displays come away as easily as the one in the video!
